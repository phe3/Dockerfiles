# For Dockerfiles

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-honeypot.svg?branch=8.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-honeypot)


## About

This is a personal repo for collecting Dockerfiles I use.

## Configuration

Each directory represents a dockerhub tag which will be autobuilt as soon as I push new code to this repo.
The main purpose of this collections is to be accessible and simple, I'll be using lightweight base images, 
making sure to have only the necessary to run, being fast and secure.


## Use in Your Own Forms

Each container image has its own configurations. Please check the readmes inside their directories.

## Credit
